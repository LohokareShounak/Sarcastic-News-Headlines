# Sarcasm Detection in News Headlines

Using various NLP techniques to identify sarcasm in headlines

## Description

Used 3 different LSTM Models and one transformer based model to predict sarcasm. 

Check out Model_Info.txt file for model specification.

LSTM Models were trained in Pytorch framework, while Transformer model wsa trained in Tensorflow and Pytorch framework, both gave fairly similar result

Here is the Google Colab Link for the transformer part of the project - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pwrrO6M4lx70lSF2VfCkjGJteKyigbyG?usp=sharing

Pytorch based transformer model is also available as a pre trained model in hugging face library, you can check out the below link -
